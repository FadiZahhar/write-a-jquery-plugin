# [Write a jQuery Plugin][published url]
## Instructor: [Jeremy McPeak][instructor url]


jQuery is the most popular JavaScript library. One of the reasons for that popularity is jQuery's extensibility. Not only does jQuery give us a lot of goodies out of the box, but the community has created a whole ecosystem of open-source plugins. jQuery plugins are a great way to componentize and share your code. 

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Jeremy McPeak will show you how to extend jQuery by writing a plugin. You'll get to follow along as he creates a simple accordian plugin for displaying collapsable outlines. You'll learn the basics of plugin creation, and also how to enhance your plugin with settings and methods.
